This dataset contains 15936 near-infrared spectra of six types of materials including ceramic, stainless steel, wood, cardboard, plastic and glass. A total of 54 different daily used objects were selected. This material/objectselection pattern would expand the universality of our datasets. For each object 10 sample were selected for data collection and for each sample about 30 nir spectra was gather using SciO sensor depending on the size of the sample. To  sum  up, there were six materials, 54 objects, 540 samples and 15936 scans in this dataset. In addition, python codes for several preprocesing method are also included.
